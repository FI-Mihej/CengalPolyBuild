# CengalPolyBuild: A Comprehensive and Hackable Build System for Multilingual Python Packages

Our build system offers an automatic, customizable framework tailored for Python packages that incorporate modules in various programming languages. It is specifically designed to support Cython (including automatic conversion from Python to Cython), C/C++, Objective-C, Go, and Nim, with ongoing expansions to include additional languages.

Key Features:

* Automatic Compilation: Seamlessly compiles your code and gathers binary artifacts to integrate into your Python wheel.
* Module Management: Provides templates for easy management of project modules. You can add, rename, or move modules within the project tree effortlessly.
* License Management: Automates the download of license texts based on specified names and inserts license headers directly into your source files.
* Version Management: Facilitates the tracking and updating of version numbers in your sources, ensuring consistency across your project.

This build system is designed to simplify the development process, enhance productivity, and ensure your project adheres to licensing and versioning standards effectively.

# Based on [Cengal](https://github.com/FI-Mihej/Cengal)

This is a stand-alone package for a specific Cengal module. Package is designed to offer users the ability to install specific Cengal functionality without the burden of the library's full set of dependencies.

The core of this approach lies in our 'cengal-light' package, which houses both Python and compiled Cengal modules. The 'cengal' package itself serves as a lightweight shell, devoid of its own modules, but dependent on 'cengal-light[full]' for a complete Cengal library installation with all required dependencies.

An equivalent import:
```python
```

Cengal library can be installed by:

```bash
pip install cengal
```
